# ggplot2bdc

ggplot2bdc is a collection of themes and other things that can be used when
creating plots with [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/).

# Installation

`ggplot2bdc` is not on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/), but you can use
[devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to
install the latest and greatest version. To do so:

    library(devtools)
    install_github('briandconnelly/ggplot2bdc')


# Examples

To gain access to the following themes, etc. provided, first load the
`gplot2bdc` package


```r
library(ggplot2bdc)
```


## theme_bdc_simplefacets

`theme_bdc_simplefacets` is a clean theme that uses thin black panels on a white
background. Legends are placed above. Facets labels are displayed as black text.
Subtle grid lines can be added to the panels with the `grid.x` and `grid.y`
parameters.


```r
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = budget/1e+06, color = rating)) + geom_point() + 
    facet_grid(mpaa ~ .) + labs(x = "Year", y = "Budget ($ Millions)", title = "Hollywood Budgets Against Time") + 
    theme_bdc_simplefacets(grid.y = TRUE, grid.x = FALSE)
```

## theme_bdc_grey

`theme_bdc_grey` is a clean theme that uses thin grey panels on a white
background. Legends are placed above. Facet labels are displayed as black text
on a grey background.


```r
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = budget/1e+06, color = rating)) + geom_point() + 
    facet_grid(mpaa ~ .) + labs(x = "Year", y = "Budget ($ Millions)", title = "Hollywood Budgets Against Time") + 
    theme_bdc_grey()
```

![plot of chunk theme_bdc_grey](figure/theme_bdc_grey.png) 


Subtle grid lines can be added to the panels with the `grid.x` and `grid.y`
parameters:


```r
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = budget/1e+06, color = rating)) + geom_point() + 
    facet_grid(mpaa ~ .) + labs(x = "Year", y = "Budget ($ Millions)", title = "Hollywood Budgets Against Time") + 
    theme_bdc_grey(grid.x = FALSE, grid.y = TRUE)
```

## theme_bdc_black

`theme_bdc_black` is a clean theme that uses thin black panels on a white
background. Legends are placed above. Facet labels are displayed as black text
on a grey background. Subtle grid lines can be added to the panels with the
`grid.x` and `grid.y` parameters.


```r
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = budget/1e+06, color = rating)) + geom_point() + 
    facet_grid(mpaa ~ .) + labs(x = "Year", y = "Budget ($ Millions)", title = "Hollywood Budgets Against Time") + 
    theme_bdc_black(grid.y = TRUE, grid.x = FALSE)
```

## theme_bdc_simple

`theme_bdc_simple` is a classic theme that displays plot axes as solid black
lines on a white background. This theme is probably best suited to single-panel
plots.


```r
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = length, color = rating, shape = mpaa)) + geom_point() + 
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Length (Minutes)", title = "Movie Lengths Against Time") + 
    scale_y_log10() + theme_bdc_simple()
```

## coord_golden

`coord_golden` sets the aspect ratio of the axes according to the golden ratio.
For an introduction to how aspect ratio affects perception, see
[Aspect Ratio and Banking to 45 Degrees](http://eagereyes.org/basics/banking-45-degrees).


```r
library(dplyr)

pg_movies <- filter(movies, mpaa == "PG")

ggplot(pg_movies, aes(x = year, y = budget/10^6, color = rating)) + geom_point() + 
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Budget ($ Millions)", title = "PG-13 Movie Budgets") + 
    theme_bdc_grey() + coord_golden(xvals = pg_movies$year, yvals = pg_movies$budget/10^6)
```

## coord_square

`coord_square` sets the aspect ratio of the axes according to a square.
