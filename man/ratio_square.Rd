\title{Calculate the aspect ratio of data that would create a square}
\usage{
ratio_square(xvals, yvals)
}
\arguments{
\item{xvals}{Vector containing the values plotted along the X axis}

\item{yvals}{Vector containing the values plotted along the Y axis}
}
\value{
A numeric value containing the aspect ratio that would produce a plot
with square proportions
}
\description{
\code{ratio_square} returns the aspect ratio (\code{y/x}) that would produce
a plot where the space that covers one unit along the x axis would correspond
to 1 along the y axis.
}
\note{
This function may be useful to establish a starting aspect ratio to
use when "\href{http://eagereyes.org/basics/banking-45-degrees}{banking to 45}".

\examples{
ratio <- ratio_square(xvals=mtcars$hp, yvals=mtcars$mpg)
